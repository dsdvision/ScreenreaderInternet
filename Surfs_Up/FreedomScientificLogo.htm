<p>The Freedom Scientific logo is a picture of a hot air balloon with light blue colored stripes mixed with white stripes. The balloon looks like it is being pushed by a strong wind. To the right of the balloon are the words Freedom Scientific&reg;. The text of the word Freedom is colored black, and the text of the word Scientific is the same color blue as the blue in the balloon.</p>
