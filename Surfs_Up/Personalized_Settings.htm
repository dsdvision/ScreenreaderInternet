<h1>Personalized Web Page Settings</h1>

<p>You can configure many JAWS settings for specific Web sites. Personalized settings apply to all pages of a given domain, such as CNN dot com or Freedom Scientific dot com. Some examples where using personalized settings could be useful might include:</p>

<ul>
	<li>Turn off heading announcement on Web sites that use headings to format information rather than structure it.</li>
	<li>Turn off inline frames on sites that use them for advertising.</li>
	<li>Turn off announcement of image map links on sites that do not provide alternate text for them, but do provide text links as well.</li>
	<li>And more...</li>
</ul>

<p>Make the various JAWS settings work for you to enhance your experiences on the Internet.</p>

<p>JAWS includes many configurable settings to access information on Web pages as efficiently as possible, and JAWS uses default settings that provide the most information on the majority of Web sites. However, there are many Web sites that are not designed with accessibility in mind or do not use HTML correctly. When using JAWS default settings, some of these Web pages may not provide enough information, while others may provide too much.</p>

<h2>What Settings can be Personalized?</h2>

<p>You can personalize many types of Web settings. For example:</p>

<ul>
	<li>Prevent Web sites from automatically refreshing, so the information does not reload and cause JAWS to read from the top of the page all over again.</li>
	<li>Turn off graphic links on sites where alternate text is not provided or where the graphic links do not provide useful information.</li>
	<li>Turn off heading announcement when headings are not used to structure information on a page.</li>
	<li>Turn off navigation quick keys on pages that use certain types of access keys so the keys do not conflict.</li>
	<li>Personalize Web settings for forms, frames, lists, and long quotations.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Personalizing Web Settings</h2>

<p>Do the following to create or modify personalized settings for a Web page. Note that changes made are saved permanently to JSI files (for example, FreedomScientific.com.jsi) and do not apply to other Web pages. JSI files are stored in the PersonalizedSettings folder, which can be found by opening the Utilities menu from the JAWS window, selecting the Explore Utilities Folder option, and then choosing Explore My Settings.</p>

<ol>
  <li>Press <strong>INSERT+V </strong>to open the Quick Settings dialog box. Focus is in the Search edit box.
  <li>Press <strong>DOWN ARROW </strong>to move to the Quick Settings tree view. </li>
  <li>Press <strong>P </strong>to move to the Personalize Web Settings group. If necessary, press <strong>RIGHT ARROW </strong>to expand the group.</li>
  <li>Press <strong>DOWN ARROW </strong>to move to the different options and groups within Personalize Web Settings, and press <strong>SPACEBAR </strong>to make changes.</li>
  <li>After making all necessary changes, press <strong>TAB </strong>to move to the OK button and then press <strong>SPACEBAR </strong>to save changes and exit Quick Settings.</li>
</ol>

<h2>Sharing Personalized Settings</h2>

<p>JAWS stores personalized settings information in JSI files. To share your personalized settings with other JAWS users</p>
<ol>
	<li>From the JAWS application window, press <strong>ALT+U</strong> to open the Utilities menu and press <strong>X</strong> to activate the Explore Utilities Folder option.</li>
	<li>Navigate to Explore My Settings and press <strong>ENTER</strong>. A folder opens that contains all of the files you have had JAWS modify or create for you.</li>
	<li>Select the folder PersonalizedSettings and press <strong>ENTER</strong> to open it.</li>
	<li>Locate the JSI file with the domain name of the page that uses the personalized settings you want to share. For example: "Google.com.jsi."</li>
	<li>Copy this file and distribute it to others. Those you share your JSI file with need to copy the JSI file into their user folder on their computer following the steps above. They can now use that HTML page with your personalized settings.</li>
