<h2 id="get">Getting Started With Surf's Up</h2>

<p>You can use Surf's Up with the web browser of your choice, however, many of our exercises and examples regularly refer to the Google Chrome&trade; web browser. Chrome is one of the most popular browsers today as it is frequently updated to support the latest web standards. If you choose to use Chrome and it is already installed on your computer, you can launch it by selecting the Google Chrome shortcut on the Desktop.</p>

<h3>Install Google Chrome</h3>

<p>If you would like to install Chrome, do the following:</p>

<ol>
<li>From a web browser such as Internet Explorer or Firefox&trade;, go to the <a href="https://www.chrome.com" target="_blank">Chrome download page</a>.</li>
<li>Press <strong>B</strong> to move to the Download Chrome button and press <strong>ENTER</strong>.</li>
<li>Press <strong>B</strong> to move to the Accept and Install button and press <strong>ENTER</strong>. Chrome will automatically download and install.</li>
</ol>

<h3>Install Mozilla Firefox</h3>

<p>If you would like to install Mozilla&trade; Firefox&trade;, do the following:</p>

<ol>
	<li>From a web browser such as Google Chrome, go to the <a href="https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/new/" target="_blank">Firefox download page</a>.</li>
	<li>Press <strong>INSERT+F7</strong> to open the JAWS list of links, and then choose the Download Now or Download in another language link.</li>

</ol>

<h3>JAWS Help Keystrokes</h3>

<p>JAWS provides context-sensitive help for many different elements you might encounter in web pages. To read help information for the current web page, or for an element within a web page, press <strong>INSERT+F1</strong>. For general help with whatever browser you are using press <strong>INSERT+F1</strong> twice quickly while the browser is the active window. For Hot Key Help for browsers (or other apps) with JAWS press <strong>INSERT+H</strong>.</p>

<h3>Tabbed Browsing</h3>

<p>Many of the exercise pages and keystroke command pages in <em>Surf's Up</em> either open in new browser windows or in new browser tabs, depending on how your version of any browser is set up. You can press <strong>ALT+TAB</strong> to move between the different open windows, or <strong>CTRL+TAB</strong> to move between different tab pages in the current browser session. Also remember to close the open windows by pressing <strong>ALT+F4</strong> when you are finished with them or close a single tab page by pressing <strong>CTRL+F4</strong>.</p>

<h3>The JAWS Key</h3>

<p>You will notice occasional references to the JAWS key when using JAWS. This key is used by JAWS in combination with other keys on the keyboard to perform various actions. For example, the <strong>JAWS Key+T</strong> reads the title of the current document while <strong>JAWS Key+F7</strong> opens a list of links in a web page.</p>

<p>The default JAWS keys are as follows:</p>

<ul>
<li>JAWS desktop layout uses the <strong>INSERT</strong> key</li>
<li>JAWS laptop layout uses the <strong>CAPS LOCK</strong> key</li>
</ul>

<p>The JAWS key can be changed from the <strong>INSERT</strong> key to the <strong>CAPS LOCK</strong> or <strong>SCROLL LOCK</strong> key. This can be done by opening the list of JAWS managers (<strong>INSERT+F2</strong>) and choosing Settings Center. The JAWS Key for either desktop or laptop layout is found in the Keyboard branch of the tree view. This must be changed in the default settings which can be selected by pressing <strong>CTRL+SHIFT+D</strong>.</p>

<h3>Access Keys to Navigate by Page Forward or Backward in Surf's Up</h3>

<p>Finally, at the bottom of each page in Surf's Up are links to the next or prior page. Use the following Access Keys to navigate forward or backward one page at a time in Surf's Up:</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>ALT+N</strong> activates the Next page link</li>
<li><strong>ALT+B</strong> activates the Back link to move to the prior page</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>NOTE:</strong> Firefox adds the <strong>SHIFT</strong> key to the key combination for access keys on web pages. If you use Firefox, press <strong>ALT+SHIFT+N</strong> or <strong>ALT+SHIFT+B</strong> to move to the next or prior pages with the access keys in Surf's Up.</p>
